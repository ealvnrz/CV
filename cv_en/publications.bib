	title = {Methane {Dynamics} in the {Wupper}-{Vorsperre} {Reservoir}: {Insights} from {Sediment} {Characterization} and {VFA} {Monitoring}},
	doi = {Under Review},
	abstract = {Purpose: Methane (CH4) contributes significantly to global warming, with man-made
reservoirs accounting for approximately 6\% of its emissions. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) can stimulate CH4 production by functioning as methanogenesis substrates. Consequently, monitoring VFA has gained importance in anaerobic digestion (AD) due to its influence on CH4 yield. However, typical monitoring techniques, such as titration,
are rarely used for reservoir sediment monitoring.
Methods: This study characterizes sediment in Germany's Wupper-Vorsperre reservoir and compares Nordmann's titration and the more precise High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for measuring VFAs. Sediment samples were collected and
biogas was extracted during 2020-2022.
Results: Sediment analysis reveals consistently low total organic carbon (TOC), organic matter (OM) and total nitrogen (TN) values with minimal seasonal variation. The carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio falls within the lower limit ideal for biogas production, with higher CH4 content during warmer seasons. Although titration underestimates sediment's VFA values regarding HPLC, by a mean difference of 15.7 mg/L, there is a significant correlation between the two methods (r = 0.96, p {\textless} 0.001)
with an Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.84. Moreover, a weak correlation (r=0.31) was found between VFA and CH4 content.
Conclusion: The area studied is not a CH4 ebullition hotspot emphasizing the role of OM burial in driving methane emissions and highlighting the significance of VFA as a predictor of methane content in sediments. Future research may aim to improve titration accuracy to develop an early in-situ indicator of CH4 content and study VFA's
influence on CH4 formation in reservoir sediments.},

abstract = {The Gaussian copula is a powerful tool that has been widely used to model spatial and/or temporal correlated data with arbitrary marginal distributions. However, this kind of model can potentially be too restrictive since it expresses a reflection symmetric dependence. In this paper, we propose a new spatial copula model that makes it possible to obtain random fields with arbitrary marginal distributions with a type of dependence that can be reflection symmetric or not. Particularly, we propose a new random field with uniform marginal distributions that can be viewed as a spatial generalization of the classical Clayton copula model. It is obtained through a power transformation of a specific instance of a beta random field which in turn is obtained using a transformation of two independent Gamma random fields. For the proposed random field, we study the second-order properties and we provide analytic expressions for the bivariate distribution and its correlation. Finally, in the reflection symmetric case, we study the associated geometrical properties. As an application of the proposed model we focus on spatial modeling of data with bounded support. Specifically, we focus on spatial regression models with marginal distribution of the beta type. In a simulation study, we investigate the use of the weighted pairwise composite likelihood method for the estimation of this model. Finally, the effectiveness of our methodology is illustrated by analyzing point-referenced vegetation index data using the Gaussian copula as benchmark. Our developments have been implemented in an open-source package for the R statistical environment.}

  abstract  = {Risk factors associated with tooth loss have been studied; however, the current status of the epidemiological profiles and the impact of the pandemic on the oral health of the elderly is still unknown. This study aims to determine the experience of caries and tooth loss among elderly Chilean citizens in five regions and to identify the risk factors associated with tooth loss. The sample includes 135 participants over 60 years old assessed during COVID-19 lockdown. Sociodemographic variables such as education and RSH (Social Registry of Households) were obtained through a teledentistry platform called TEGO. The history of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, depression and dental caries reported by DMFT index scores were incorporated. The statistical analysis included Adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) to assess risk factors associated with the lack of functional dentition. Multivariate hypothesis testing was used to compare the mean equality of DMFT and its components between regions (p-value {\textless} 0.05). Individuals with RSH ≤ 40\% were at higher risk of having no functional dentition with OR 4.56 (95\% CI: 1.71, 12.17). The only mean difference between regions was the filled tooth component. Tooth loss was associated with multidimensional lower income, where the elderly belonging to the 40\% most vulnerable population had a higher prevalence of non-functional dentition. This study highlights the importance of implementing a National Oral Health Policy that focuses on oral health promotion and minimally invasive dentistry for the most vulnerable population.},
